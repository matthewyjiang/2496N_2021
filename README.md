# 2496N's 2020-2021 Change Up Code

This is the Repository for 2496N's Change Up code. This repository will be updated as we make changes to the code, and is open for others to view code and download.

This repository houses a standard PROS Project, a VEX V5 coding library.

2496N Members: Please send me your GitHub Account so that I can add you to this repository as a contributor.

## Learn to Program!

Programming is pretty cool. This project uses PROS, a VEX V5 coding library based on C++ and C. It's recommended that you teach yourself some basic C++ concepts before attempting to modify this code. 

If you need help, ask Matt, but check [the PROS V5 API](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/api/index.html) first.

## Style Guide: For Consistency

Curly braces start on the same line:
```cpp
while(true){
  doSomething();
}

if(something){
  doSomething();
} else if(somethingElse){
  doSomethingElse();
} else {
  youGetThePoint();
}
```
User created names use camelCase:
```cpp
int thisIsHowYouWriteCamelCase = 0;
```
Spaces between operators:
```cpp
if(x == y){
  a + b = c;
}

i = j ? k : l;
```
Indents = 4 spaces. Please.

Thats it
