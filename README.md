# Style Guide: For Consistency

Curly braces start on the same line:
```
while(true){
  doSomething();
}

if(something){
  doSomething();
} else if(somethingElse){
  doSomethingElse();
} else {
  youGetThePoint();
}
```
User created names use camelCase:
```
int thisIsHowYouWriteCamelCase = 0;
```
Spaces between operators:
```
if(x == y){
  a + b = c;
}

i = j ? k : l;
```
Indents = 4 spaces. Please.

Thats it
