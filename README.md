# Style Guide: For Consistency

Curly Braces start on the same line:
```
while(true){
  doSomething();
}
```
User Created Names use camelCase:
```
int thisIsHowYouWriteCamelCase = 0;
```
Spaces between operators:
```
if(x == y){
  a + b = c;
}

i = j ? k : l;
```
Indents = 4 spaces. Please.

Thats it
